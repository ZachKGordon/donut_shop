We created a donut table that brakes down the inventory of 5 different locations of Top Pot based on Max customers, Min customers and their average purchases. We used an object to represent locations, random numbers to model business and DOM methods to assign data.

I had a problem displaying the array data in the table so though so the data I used is wrong i believe because it doesn't add up to the total.
